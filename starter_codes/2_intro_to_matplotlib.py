# Matplotlib is the most used plotting package
# in python. It was designed to mimic the plotting
# syntax and functionality from Matlab, hence
# the name matplotlib.
#
# Just like when we imported numpy "as np"
# it is standard to have two separate imports
# with simplified aliases 
# 
# The base `mpl` import is used for high level 
# settings like setting a default figure or font
# size. The import of `plt` provides the main 
# interface to the actual plotting functions.
# 
# To begin, we define the same air pressure
# function as well as import numpy. Numpy and
# matplotlib have been designed to work very 
# well together
#
# Just like with numpy, matplotlib is a very
# large and general purpose library so we won't
# be able to cover everything.
#
# The introductory tutorials can be  found here:

# Okay, our first plot will be the variation
# of the air pressure with respect to elevation.
# To do this, we will first create our two arrays,
# one for the elevations and then we feed that
# into our nice function just like in the previous
# notebook.
#
# From there we can just use the `plt.plot`
# function to make the plot. Pretty nifty!

heights = np.arange(0, 20000, 50)
pressures = air_pressure_at_height(heights)

plt.plot(pressures)

# %%
# Hmmm, something is going on with that x axis.
# It only shows up to 400 but our heights array
# goes to 20,000! What's going on there? We only
# gave the plot function the pressures, so it knows
# nothing about the heights. By default matplotlib
# will just label the x axis with 0 to N where N
# is the length of the array you passed in to the 
# plot function.
#
# To get both, you can optionally pass in both
# what you want on the x axis *and* what you 
# want on the y axis.
plt.plot(heights, pressures)

# %%
# One problem though. If you gave this plot
# to a colleague they would have no clue what it
# is telling them. To help them out let's add some
# axis labels. This can be done with the `plt.xlabel`
# and `plt.ylabel` functions. Matplotlib automatically
# knows to put them on the current plot.
plt.plot(heights, pressures)
plt.xlabel('Height above sea level [m]')
plt.ylabel('Air pressure [pa]')

# %%
# Beautiful! But, we're not done yet. If you've looked
# closely at the function for the air pressure you might
# have noticed we added a new argument `T0` with a default
# argument of 273.15. By a default argument we mean that 
# if you don't supply an alternative, it sets that one as
# the value. But we know air pressure is a function of 
# temperature and so we might want to see how that affects
# things. Let's try a few and plot them.
# 
# To do that we just need to run a few new calculations, 
# and then call the `plt.plot` function on each of the 
# results.

# This is awesome, but we're back to the fact that
# if you handed this to someone else they would not have 
# a way of knowing what the different lines are for.
# We can remedy this by adding `label`s to each of the calls
# to `plt.plot`. Once those have been added we just call
# `plt.legend()` after we are done plotting the lines to
# add it to the figure

# A final step on this particular plot. You can use
# all of this functionality in loops so that your code
# is a bit shorter and easier to modify. Let's look at
# how
temps = [273, 293, 313, 333]

# Okay, line plots are cool, but what else can
# matplotlib do? Let's look at images. So for this
# one we'll first run the air pressure function over
# many different temperatures. 
# 
# We then `stack` the results of our loop, which just
# makes the whole thing a numpy array rather than a 
# list of numpy arrays. This is so matplotlib can 
# interpret what we want. 
#
# QUIZ: What's the resulting dimension of `pressures`
#       after calling np.stack ?
# 
# Finally we call  `plt.colorbar` just so we know what
# the values for the different colors are.
temps = np.arange(200, 400, 1)
pressures = []
for T in temps:
    p_new = air_pressure_at_height(heights, T0=T)

# Stack just sticks a list of numpy arrays 
# together along a new dimension
pressures = np.stack(pressures)
ax = plt.imshow(pressures)
plt.colorbar(

# Hmmm, now we're back to the problem where
# we don't know what the x and y axes represent.
# To fix this we'll need to get into a slightly more
# complex way of plotting. This mode requires more code
# but is better for flexibility. For exploratory analysis 
# you can usually get away with just calling `plt.WHATEVER`
# but this way of explicitly creating the `plt.figure` is
# usually better for detailed plotting.
# 
# This one is a little bit complicated so it's okay if
# it doesn't click right now, but I wanted to show it
# because it is something common to need to make, but
# a bit difficult, so I wanted to provide a reference.
# This took me ~10 mins to re-figure out even though
# I have been using matplotlib since ~2012.
